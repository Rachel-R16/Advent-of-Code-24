# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This is where I share my solutions to the daily programming puzzles from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024), a yearly coding challenge that runs every December.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is a series of 25 coding puzzles released daily from December 1st to December 25th. Each challenge is designed to improve your problem-solving skills and can be tackled in any programming language. It's a fun way to learn, experiment, and connect with the developer community during the holiday season.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized as follows:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Day 01/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ D1 Input.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ D1 Code.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ Day 02/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ D2 Input.txt
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ D2 Code.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ ... (one folder per day)
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

### Folder Contents

- **`input.txt`**: Contains the input data for the day's puzzle.
- **`solution.py`**: My solution for the puzzle in Python.
- **`README.md`**: A brief description of the day's problem and my approach.

## Goals for Advent of Code 2024

1. **Consistency**: Complete each puzzle daily or catch up as needed.
2. **Clean Code**: Write clear, well-documented solutions with comments.
3. **Efficiency**: Strive for optimal solutions with a balance of readability and performance.
4. **Learning**: Explore new programming techniques and improve algorithmic thinking.

## Notes on Solutions

- My primary language is **Python**.
- Each solution aims to strike a balance between readability and performance.
- I include comments to explain key steps in my code and occasionally reference alternate approaches.

Happy coding and enjoy the challenges! ðŸŽ…âœ¨
