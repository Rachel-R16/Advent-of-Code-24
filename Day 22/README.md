# Day 22: Monkey Market

## Problem Description
A monkey steals The Historians' device and demands an absurd number of bananas to return it. To gather bananas, you must sell hiding spots on the Monkey Exchange Market. Buyers on the market use pseudorandom sequences to determine their prices, which are derived from secret numbers using a specific set of operations. Each buyer's secret number evolves into subsequent numbers through a series of transformations, including mixing and pruning.

### Part One
Part 1 involves calculating the sum of the 2000th secret number generated by each buyer.

### Part Two
In Part 2, buyers offer prices based on the last digit of their secret numbers. Your task is to identify the best sequence of four price changes that maximizes the number of bananas received when the monkey sells a hiding spot.

## Solution Overview
The solution involves simulating the evolution of secret numbers for each buyer and analyzing the generated sequences to solve both parts of the problem.

### Input
The input consists of a list of integers, each representing the initial secret number for a buyer.

### Output
The program outputs:
1. The sum of the 2000th secret number generated by each buyer.
2. The maximum number of bananas that can be obtained by identifying the optimal sequence of four price changes.

### Approach
1. **Evolution Function**:
   - Simulate the evolution of secret numbers based on the given rules.
   - Use bitwise XOR for mixing and modulo operations for pruning.

2. **Part 1**:
   - For each buyer, simulate 2000 evolutions of their secret number.
   - Extract the 2000th secret number and compute the sum.

3. **Part 2**:
   - Derive prices from the last digit of each secret number.
   - Calculate the price changes between consecutive prices.
   - Identify the sequence of four price changes that yields the highest number of bananas when matched across all buyers.

### Part 1 Output:
```
Part 1 - Sum of the 2000th secret number for each buyer: 15006633487
```

### Part 2 Output:
```
Part 2 - Highest number of bananas possible: 1710
```

## Conclusion
By accurately simulating the evolution of secret numbers and analyzing price changes, the problem demonstrates how to leverage pseudorandom sequences for optimization. Part 1 emphasizes correct implementation of the evolution rules, while Part 2 focuses on pattern recognition to maximize outcomes.
